# Meta Learning
Here are the implementation of some of the most important papers in meta learning.
1. **Black box meta-learning**: This is the implementation of [SNAIL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03141) paper which is a good example of a black box meta learning algorithm.

2. **Optimization-based meta-learning**: A simple implementation of [MAML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) paper.

3. **Metric-based meta-learning**: Prototypical networks are prime examples of metric-based meta-learning algorithms. This is the implementation of [PrototypicalNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175) paper.
